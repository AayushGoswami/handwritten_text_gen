# Project Flow: Handwritten Text Generation

## 1. Problem Understanding & Requirements
- Review the task objectives and dataset format.
- Define success criteria for generated handwritten text.

## 2. Data Exploration & Preprocessing
- Load and inspect the provided `.npz` datasets.
- Visualize sample data to understand input/output structure.
- Preprocess data as needed (normalization, sequence formatting, etc.).

## 3. Model Selection & Design
- Research suitable generative models (e.g., RNN, LSTM, GRU, Transformer, or specialized handwriting synthesis models).
- Design the model architecture for sequence generation.

## 4. Model Implementation
- Implement the model using a deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch).
- Set up data loaders and batching.

## 5. Training & Hyperparameter Tuning
- Train the model on the training dataset.
- Experiment with hyperparameters (learning rate, sequence length, layers, etc.).
- Monitor training/validation loss and adjust as needed.

## 6. Evaluation & Visualization
- Generate handwritten text samples using the trained model.
- Compare generated samples with real samples for quality assessment.
- Visualize results for qualitative evaluation.

## 7. Documentation & Reporting
- Document code and write clear comments.
- Prepare a README with:
  - Project objectives
  - Setup and usage instructions
  - Model details and results

## 8. Final Review & Submission
- Ensure code quality and reproducibility.
- Double-check deliverables and documentation.
